I have a Bachelor's degree in Economics (FEA-USP) and a Master's degree in Political Science (DCP-USP, with a scholarship from FAPESP). At the moment, I am a researcher in Centro de Estudos da Metrópole (Cebrap). I already had the opportunity to share my work in newspapers (Folha de S.Paulo), academic journals (Revista Brasileira de Economia, Revista Teoria & Pesquisa), and academic conferences (such as IPSA, ABCP, ANPOCS). My research topics are political behavior, income inequality, and preferences for redistribution.
